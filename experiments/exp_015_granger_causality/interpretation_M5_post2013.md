## Coefficient Interpretations
Complementary log-log model. Exponentiated coefficients approximate hazard ratios.

- **family_connection_ratio**: HR=0.6598, decreases hazard by 34.0% *** (p=0.0000)
- **family_ownership_pct**: HR=0.9841, decreases hazard by 1.6%  (p=0.8148)
- **state_ownership_pct**: HR=0.8420, decreases hazard by 15.8%  (p=0.1204)
- **foreign_ownership_total_pct**: HR=0.9967, decreases hazard by 0.3%  (p=0.9427)
- **rw_page_rank_4q_lag**: HR=1.1496, increases hazard by 15.0% *** (p=0.0001)
- **rw_out_degree_4q_lag**: HR=0.3488, decreases hazard by 65.1% *** (p=0.0000)
- **camel_roa**: HR=0.8969, decreases hazard by 10.3% *** (p=0.0000)
- **camel_npl_ratio**: HR=1.1296, increases hazard by 13.0% *** (p=0.0003)
- **camel_tier1_capital_ratio**: HR=1.1486, increases hazard by 14.9% *** (p=0.0000)
