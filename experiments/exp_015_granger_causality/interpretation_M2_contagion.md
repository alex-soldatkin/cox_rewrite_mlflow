# Interpretation: M2: + Community contagion control

## Coefficient Interpretations
Complementary log-log model. Exponentiated coefficients approximate hazard ratios.

- **family_connection_ratio**: HR=0.6498, decreases hazard by 35.0% *** (p=0.0000)
- **family_ownership_pct**: HR=0.9515, decreases hazard by 4.9%  (p=0.4006)
- **state_ownership_pct**: HR=0.8236, decreases hazard by 17.6% + (p=0.0800)
- **foreign_ownership_total_pct**: HR=0.9703, decreases hazard by 3.0%  (p=0.5863)
- **rw_page_rank_4q_lag**: HR=1.1605, increases hazard by 16.0% *** (p=0.0000)
- **rw_out_degree_4q_lag**: HR=0.4682, decreases hazard by 53.2% *** (p=0.0000)
- **camel_roa**: HR=0.9320, decreases hazard by 6.8% *** (p=0.0000)
- **camel_npl_ratio**: HR=1.2585, increases hazard by 25.8% *** (p=0.0000)
- **camel_tier1_capital_ratio**: HR=1.0952, increases hazard by 9.5% *** (p=0.0006)
- **community_failure_lag**: HR=0.9640, decreases hazard by 3.6%  (p=0.1927)
