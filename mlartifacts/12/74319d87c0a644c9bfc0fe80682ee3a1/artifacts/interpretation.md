# Interpretation Report: M3: FCR Focus (Minimal Controls)

## 1. Variable Interpretations
Interpretation logic: *Holding all other covariates constant...*

- **family_connection_ratio**: A one-unit increase decreases the hazard of failure by **1.4%**. (*** p<0.001)
- **camel_roa**: A one-unit increase decreases the hazard of failure by **9.3%**. (*** p<0.001)
- **camel_npl_ratio**: A one-unit increase increases the hazard of failure by **0.4%**. (* p<0.05)
- **foreign_ownership_total_pct**: A one-unit increase increases the hazard of failure by **0.1%**. (not significant)
- **state_ownership_pct**: A one-unit increase decreases the hazard of failure by **0.6%**. (not significant)

## 2. Most Protective Variables (Decreased Risk)
Ranked by strength of protection (largest % decrease in hazard).

1. **camel_roa***: Reduces hazard by **9.3%** (HR = 0.907)
2. **family_connection_ratio***: Reduces hazard by **1.4%** (HR = 0.986)
3. **state_ownership_pct**: Reduces hazard by **0.6%** (HR = 0.994)

## 3. Highest Risk Variables (Increased Risk)
Ranked by strength of risk (largest % increase in hazard).

1. **camel_npl_ratio***: Increases hazard by **0.4%** (HR = 1.004)
2. **foreign_ownership_total_pct**: Increases hazard by **0.1%** (HR = 1.001)
