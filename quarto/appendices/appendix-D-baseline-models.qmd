## Cross-sectional logistic regression (exp_002)

The baseline cross-sectional analysis employs logistic regression to estimate the probability of bank failure as a function of ownership structure, financial indicators, and network position measured at a single point in time. This approach provides a foundation for the more sophisticated time-varying Cox models used in the main analysis.

### Specification

$$\Pr(\text{failure}_i = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\boldsymbol{X}_i' \boldsymbol{\beta})}$$

where $\boldsymbol{X}_i$ includes CAMEL indicators, ownership measures (family, state, foreign percentages), and network centrality metrics.

### Key results

- Family connection ratio increases survival odds by approximately 63% in the cross-sectional specification

- Network centrality metrics (PageRank, betweenness) are significant predictors of survival

- Foreign ownership provides strong protection (482% increase in survival odds in some specifications)

- Model accuracy ranges from 75--85% depending on the variable set included

### Limitations

The cross-sectional approach cannot account for time-varying dynamics, survival bias, or the temporal sequence of network formation and failure. These limitations motivate the time-varying Cox models in the main analysis.

## Basic Cox models (exp_003)

The initial Cox proportional hazards models extend the cross-sectional analysis to a time-to-event framework, with quarterly observations and basic time-varying covariates.

### Specification

Standard Cox model without stratification, using the full 2004--2020 period with CAMEL indicators updated quarterly.

### Key results

- Family connection ratio remains significant in the Cox framework (HR $\approx$ 0.99 per unit, $p < 0.01$)

- Hazard ratios for CAMEL indicators are consistent with the logistic regression findings

- C-index ranges from 0.60--0.65, indicating moderate discriminatory power

These baseline results establish the robustness of the family effect before the introduction of mechanism testing, stratification, and interaction models in the main analysis.
