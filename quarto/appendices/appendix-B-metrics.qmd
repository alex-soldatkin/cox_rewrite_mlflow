## Family ownership metrics

| Metric | Symbol | Formula | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Family Ownership Percentage | $FOP(b)$ | $\frac{FOV_d(b)}{TOV(b)} \times 100\%$ | Proportion of total ownership held by family-connected shareholders |
| Family Connection Ratio | $\rho_F(b)$ | $\frac{|F_b|}{|D_b|}$ | Average number of family connections per direct owner |
| Total Family Connections | $|F_b|$ | $\sum_{i \in D_b} |N_F(i)|$ | Count of family relationships amongst direct owners |
| Direct Family Ownership Value | $FOV_d(b)$ | $\sum_{i \in D_b} \omega_i \cdot \mathbf{1}_F(i)$ | Total ownership value held by family-connected shareholders |
| Family-Controlled Companies | $|C_F(b)|$ | Count of companies controlled by family members | Number of entities in the family group |
