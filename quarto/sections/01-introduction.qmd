# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Russia's banking sector offers a compelling case for examining how ownership and kinship networks shape institutional survival. From a peak of roughly 1,525 active banks in 1996, the sector has contracted to 309 institutions by mid-2025 --- about 80% of all banks that ever operated have perished. Persistent high failure rates despite formal regulatory frameworks suggest that conventional financial determinants alone cannot explain survival patterns. Informal relationship networks --- particularly those based on family connections --- play a role in institutional resilience and crisis recovery.

The sector's trajectory has been shaped by distinct institutional episodes. The 2004 revocation of Sodbiznesbank's licence --- accompanied by the murder of its shadow owner and the physical resistance of managers to CBR regulators --- exposed the fragility of formal governance and triggered a crisis of confidence across Moscow's banking system [@fridman_sodbiz_2008]. Closures steepened further with the arrival of Elvira Nabiullina as head of the Bank of Russia in 2013, who inherited 896 active banks and has since overseen the closure of more than 500. Primary closure reasons include licence revocation (typically accompanied by tax investigations), voluntary liquidation, and forced reorganisation --- exemplified by the 'sanitisation' of the Otkritie and Trust banking groups in 2017.

Prior work on Russian banking instability has focused on conventional financial determinants --- capital adequacy, profitability, asset quality, and liquidity --- supplemented by political economy variables: electoral cycles [@fungacova_PoliticsBankFailures_2022], regional corruption [@weill_HowCorruptionAffects_2011], factional associations [@soldatkin_FactionalismCompetitionEfficiency_2020], and strategic orientation [@barajas_SurvivalRussianBanks_2023]. Whilst these studies have advanced understanding of institutional dynamics, they neglect a fundamental governance mechanism: family ownership structures and kinship-based coordination networks. Family ownership is a dominant organisational form globally, with established effects on firm performance, strategic decision-making, and crisis resilience [@anderson_FoundingFamilyOwnershipFirm_2003; @villalonga_HowFamilyOwnership_2006; @khanna_EstimatingPerformanceEffects_2001] --- yet it has not been studied in the Russian banking context.

The gap is empirical, not theoretical: family relationships among Russian bank stakeholders are not recorded in public regulatory data. Identifying kinship ties requires manual coding of CBR ownership disclosures, cross-referencing surnames and patronymics, and building a database that can represent the multi-layered ownership structures characteristic of Russian banking. We overcome these constraints by constructing a Neo4j graph database that maps ownership structures, management relationships, and family connections across the Russian banking sector from 2004 to 2020.

The central research question is whether family ownership structures and kinship-based coordination networks are associated with differences in bank survival in Russia. We frame 'coordination' in precise terms: coordination **within family networks** for resource pooling (internal capital markets), information sharing (advance warning of regulatory action), and mutual support during institutional stress (liquidity backstops). This is distinct from coordination with the state; rather, family networks provide alternative mechanisms that **substitute** for the functions that reliable formal institutions would otherwise perform.

Kinship is one of several forms of informal governance relevant to Russian banking. Alumni networks, military service connections (*siloviki* associations), business partnerships, and regional friendship circles all serve as coordination mechanisms [@ledeneva_RussiaEconomyFavours_1998]. Our focus on family ties is motivated by three considerations. First, kinship relationships are **verifiable**: CBR ownership disclosures and patronymic naming conventions provide a systematic identification strategy not available for friendship or alumni ties. Second, @ledeneva_RussiaEconomyFavours_1998 foregrounds kinship as a privileged coordination mechanism in Russian informal governance, providing strong theoretical grounding. Third, prior work on factional associations [@soldatkin_FactionalismCompetitionEfficiency_2020] has established that informal political ties matter for Russian bank survival; we extend this logic to ask whether family ties --- which may overlap with, complement, or operate independently of factional associations --- constitute an additional governance mechanism.

Prominent cases illustrate this logic: the collapse of Sergei Pugachev's Mezhprombank revealed how family-controlled ownership structures could tunnel assets across international jurisdictions, whilst Centre-Invest Bank in Rostov-on-Don illustrates how regionally embedded family governance can sustain a bank through multiple crises.

We synthesise three previously disconnected literature streams --- Russian banking failures, family ownership governance, and network-based survival mechanisms --- into a framework grounded in @ledeneva_RussiaEconomyFavours_1998's distinction between 'substitution' and 'interference.' We argue that family ownership in Russian banking operates dually: mainly providing substitution functions (alternative trust and contract enforcement) during economic crises, but shifting towards interference (subverting regulatory intent through ownership fragmentation and balance sheet management) during state-led consolidation. @sec-institutional-context develops this framework with concrete examples from the study period.

We combine survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates and detailed network mapping of family relationships among Russian bank owners and senior management. Our data span 2004--2020, incorporating financial indicators, ownership structures, and family network connectivity measures derived from Central Bank corporate governance documentation. The analysis covers roughly 140,000 bank-quarter observations across 2,418 banks, with 1,117 failure events.

We test three propositions. First, banks embedded in denser kinship networks --- measured by a higher family connection ratio --- are associated with lower hazard rates, as family ties provide resource pooling and liquidity backstops that substitute for weak formal protections. Second, three specific Transaction Cost Economics mechanisms underlie this protection: political embeddedness, tax optimisation through ownership fragmentation, and internal capital markets. Third, these effects are context-dependent: beneficial during broad economic crises (2008 Global Financial Crisis), but reversing during targeted regulatory intervention (2014--2017 cleanup), where high network visibility attracts state action.

The paper proceeds as follows. @sec-literature-review reviews the literature. @sec-institutional-context develops the institutional context and theoretical framework. @sec-hypotheses formalises the hypotheses. @sec-data describes the data construction. @sec-methods explains the econometric strategy. @sec-results presents the findings. @sec-discussion discusses implications, and @sec-conclusion concludes.
