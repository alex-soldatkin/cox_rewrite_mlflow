## Temporal heterogeneity and structural breaks {#sec-results-subperiods}

We estimate the baseline model (M1) separately within three non-overlapping subperiods to test whether ownership effects are temporally stable or show structural breaks across regulatory regimes.

### Subperiod characteristics

| Period | Years | Observations | Banks | Events | Event Rate | Regime |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Early crisis | 2004--2007 | 33,966 | 944 | 669 | 70.9% | Ignatyev (post-Sodbiznesbank) |
| GFC and recovery | 2007--2013 | 70,243 | 1,001 | 688 | 68.7% | Ignatyev (financial crisis) |
| Sanctions era | 2013--2020 | 53,957 | 829 | 508 | 61.3% | Nabiullina (cleanup) |

![Temporal evolution of baseline model (M1) hazard ratios across three subperiods. The attenuation of the family connection ratio and the foreign ownership reversal are clearly visible.](figures/forest_temporal_evolution.png){#fig-forest-temporal}

@fig-forest-temporal displays the coefficient evolution visually, making the attenuation of the family effect and the foreign ownership reversal immediately apparent.

### Key findings

**Family connection ratio**: The protective effect is present across all three periods but exhibits a notable attenuation over time:

- **2004--2007**: HR = 0.982 ($p < 0.001$), corresponding to a 1.8% hazard reduction per standard deviation. This is the strongest period-specific effect, consistent with the substitution hypothesis---in the wake of the Sodbiznesbank crisis, when formal institutions were demonstrably unreliable, family networks provided the greatest marginal benefit.

- **2007--2013**: The effect remains significant but the magnitude depends on the specific crisis interactions included. The GFC period represents the classic substitution scenario: external capital markets frozen, family groups pooling internal resources.

- **2013--2020**: The baseline FCR effect weakens (HR closer to 1.0), but this must be interpreted alongside two compositional changes: (1) Nabiullina's cleanup removed the weakest banks, changing the survivor population; (2) the enhanced disclosure mandate post-2013 may have mechanically increased observed FCR for survivors (see @sec-appendix-c-reverse for the disclosure confound analysis).

**Foreign ownership reversal**: The most striking structural break occurs in foreign ownership:

- **2007--2013**: Protective (access to parent bank capital, international risk management)

- **2013--2020**: The coefficient reverses sign, becoming associated with higher hazard---consistent with sanctions-related capital flight, compliance burdens, and reduced foreign investor confidence

**Model fit**: The early period (2004--2007) achieves the highest C-index (0.661), suggesting that observable predictors have stronger discriminatory power in the early banking system, where heterogeneity in financial health was more pronounced. The post-2013 period shows moderate fit (C-index ~0.639), consistent with the hypothesis that survival determinants became more complex (and less observable) under Nabiullina's more opaque regulatory regime.

### Interaction term value by period

The value of crisis interaction terms varies dramatically across periods:

- **2004--2007**: Interactions add minimal predictive value (C-index improvement < 0.001), because the 2004 crisis was too brief to generate sufficient variation in ownership $\times$ crisis interaction effects

- **2007--2013**: Foreign $\times$ crisis interactions are most informative (C-index +0.0007), capturing the differential impact of the GFC on foreign-owned banks

- **2013--2020**: Adding crisis interactions actually *reduces* model fit, suggesting that the post-2013 environment involves complex, non-linear effects not well captured by simple multiplicative interaction terms
