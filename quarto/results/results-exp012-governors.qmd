## Regulatory regime effects {#sec-results-governors}

The transition from Sergey Ignatyev to Elvira Nabiullina as CBR governor in June 2013 represents a fundamental shift in regulatory philosophy. Ignatyev's accommodative stance (approximately 50 licence revocations per year) gave way to Nabiullina's aggressive cleanup campaign (75--100 per year, with over 500 total). This transition was not merely administrative: Nabiullina's appointment reflected a deliberate political decision by Putin to empower the CBR, bringing it into tacit conflict with banks connected to security services (*siloviki*) that had enjoyed regulatory forbearance under the previous regime. This experiment tests whether ownership effects on survival differ between regimes, controlling for crisis timing.

### Governor interaction results

The pooled Cox model with governor dummy and ownership $\times$ governor interaction terms reveals several notable findings:

**Main effects:**

- **Nabiullina era baseline**: Higher hazard (+0.2%, $p < 0.001$), consistent with the cleanup campaign increasing the overall rate of licence revocations, controlling for financial indicators and ownership structure.

- **Family connection ratio**: Protective under both regimes, but with an unexpected intensification under Nabiullina.

**Interaction effects:**

- **Family $\times$ Nabiullina**: The interaction term is weakly protective (HR interaction = 0.994, $p < 0.10$), yielding a total family effect under Nabiullina of 0.990 $\times$ 0.994 = 0.984 (1.6% hazard reduction) versus 0.990 (1.0% hazard reduction) under Ignatyev.

- **State $\times$ Nabiullina**: Borderline stronger (HR interaction = 0.996, $p = 0.11$), consistent with the hypothesis that state ownership became more protective as bailout expectations increased under Nabiullina's 'too big to fail' approach.

- **Foreign $\times$ Nabiullina**: Not significant, suggesting that the foreign ownership effects documented in the crisis interaction analysis are driven by crisis-specific dynamics (sanctions) rather than the governor regime *per se*.

### Reconciling with subperiod results

The governor regime analysis reveals an apparent contradiction with the subperiod results:

- **exp_011 (subperiods)**: Family coefficient weakens from −0.018 (2004--2007) to −0.011 (2013--2020)

- **exp_012 (regime interaction)**: Family $\times$ Nabiullina interaction is protective (intensifies under Nabiullina)

**Resolution**: These results are reconciled through the concept of **survivorship bias with intensification**:

1. The absolute FCR coefficient weakens because Nabiullina's cleanup removed the weakest family-connected banks, shrinking the pool and reducing raw variation in family effects

2. Amongst *surviving* family-connected banks, the protective effect intensifies because these are the banks that have successfully navigated the cleanup through effective use of family network mechanisms (fragmentation, internal capital markets)

3. The interaction term captures this conditional effect: given that a bank has survived into the Nabiullina era, family connections provide incrementally more protection, likely through tax optimisation mechanisms that become more valuable when regulatory scrutiny increases

This interpretation is consistent with the substitution--interference framework: under Nabiullina's stricter rules, the **interference** function of family networks (regulatory evasion through fragmentation) becomes relatively more important, and banks that effectively employ this mechanism enjoy enhanced survival advantages.
